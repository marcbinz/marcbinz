## About me

### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a video game exploration and tracking application (not yet public).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go, Elm and Svelte.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my favourite tools, programming languages and frameworks.

## My favourite tools

_in no particular order_

#### macOS

> My most beloved operating system to date.

#### Visual Studio Code

> Just the best general purpose code editor for macOS in existence.

#### JetBrains Goland | IntelliJ | ...

> The best suite of IDEs money can buy right now.

## My favourite languages & frameworks

#### Go

> A minimalistic programming language that yields great powers.

#### Elm

> The only web frontend language anyone should ever use.
>
> Functional. Clean. Safe. Reliable. Delightful.

#### Typescript

> Basically like Javascript, but in good (because types).
> 
> (Yet still no match for Elm)

#### Svelte

> Currently the best frontend framework/library/compiler next to Elm.
> 
> (This statement might be outdated tomorrow though)

#### Swift

> THE language to build native iOS apps.

#### Flutter

> Building cross-plattform apps the easy way?
> 
> (I don't know yet, but want to explore)
