## About Me

### Hello there 👋

I'm passionate about creating innovative solutions in the world of software development. Currently, my focus is:

👨🏻‍🎨 **SurrealDB Object Mapper and Query Builder** - I'm working on a typesafe object mapper and query builder called [**SOM**](https://github.com/go-surreal/som) for SurrealDB.

👨‍💻 **Tech Enthusiast** - I'm actively engaged with Go and Svelte, exploring their capabilities and pushing boundaries.

🌱 **Exploring SurrealDB** - I'm delving deep into SurrealDB, uncovering its potential and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

🔭 **Current Project** - At the moment, I'm developing a video game exploration and tracking application, though it's not yet public. Stay tuned for updates!

💬 **Ask Me Anything** - Feel free to reach out and ask me about my favorite tools, programming languages, frameworks, or anything else related to software development.

## My Favorite Tools

#### macOS 🍎

> When it comes to software development, I believe macOS offers an unparalleled experience.

#### JetBrains Goland | IntelliJ | ... 💡

> The JetBrains suite of IDEs is the gold standard for software development. They're worth every penny.

#### Visual Studio Code 📝

> Visual Studio Code is my go-to code editor. It's versatile, open-source, and well-maintained.

## My Favorite Languages & Frameworks

#### Go 🐹

> Go is a minimalist programming language with immense power, making it one of my top choices for the backend.

#### TypeScript 📝

> TypeScript, an enhanced version of JavaScript with strong typing, is my go-to choice for building robust frontend applications.

#### Svelte 🚀

> Svelte is my current favorite front-end framework/library/compiler. Its simplicity and performance are unmatched.

#### Elm 🌳

> Elm, while fantastic in terms of functional, clean, safe, and reliable web development, has lost a bit of momentum in recent times due to lack of certain features like SSR.

#### Rust 🦀

> Rust is a systems programming language known for its emphasis on safety, concurrency, and performance, making it well-suited for low-level programming tasks. I am learning Rust, particularly in conjunction with the Bevy engine, to explore game development because Rust's strong memory safety guarantees and Bevy's entity-component system provide a robust and efficient foundation for creating high-performance and reliable game applications.

#### Swift 🍏

> Swift is the language of choice for building native iOS apps, offering a seamless development experience.

#### Flutter 🦋

> Flutter has piqued my interest as a potential solution for cross-platform app development. I'm eager to explore its capabilities.

#### Java ☕

> Java is a widely-used, versatile programming language known for its platform independence and robustness, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. I have used Java primarily for corporate-level web applications in the past because Java's portability, extensive libraries, and enterprise features allowed me to develop scalable and secure web solutions that meet the demands of large organizations and business processes.
